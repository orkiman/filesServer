Project: Image Gallery File Server
Location: /home/spot/vsCodeProjects_spot/goProjects/filesServer
Current state:

Basic file server implemented
Thumbnail generation for common image formats (JPG, PNG, GIF)
Go module initialized with imaging library dependency

Target goal:
Create a web-based file server with advanced image handling capabilities, including:

Browse and view files/folders
Generate and display thumbnails for images
Support for HEIC image format
Basic search functionality
Responsive web interface

Steps completed:

Set up Go module and project structure
Implemented basic file browsing functionality
Added thumbnail generation for common image formats

Next steps:

Refine thumbnail display and caching
Implement HEIC support
Add basic search functionality
Improve the web interface for better responsiveness
Implement error handling and logging
Add configuration options (e.g., custom base directory)

When starting the next session, we can begin with refining the thumbnail system or moving on to HEIC support, depending on your preference.
Is there anything you'd like to add or modify in this project description?


Certainly! You can start a new session anytime. To prepare for continuing from this point:

Save your current code in the filesServer.go file.
Make note of the current project state:

Project location: /home/spot/vsCodeProjects_spot/goProjects/filesServer
Main file: filesServer.go
Go module initialized with github.com/disintegration/imaging dependency


Remember the last steps we discussed:

Implementing thumbnail generation
Setting up the file server with image support



When you start a new session, you can briefly recap:
"We were working on a file server project with thumbnail support. The project is located at /home/spot/vsCodeProjects_spot/goProjects/filesServer. We just implemented basic thumbnail generation for images."
This should allow us to pick up where we left off efficiently. Is there anything specific you'd like to focus on when we resume?
